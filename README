Linux platform analysis tool

checks/tests for required KABI and KAPI to support user-space
on a Linux platform.

NAME:
  linalyse:
	a tool can be used to check if Linux platform has the required
	KABI and KAPI to support the user-space. This tool checks if
	files (sysfs, dev, proc etc.) specified in the input file exist
	on the system and validates the data in those files against the
	specified in the input file.

	Further more, it can be used to check if the system has the
	required packages and libraries are installed on the system.
	These options take input file that lists the required packages
	or libraries.

	It might be necessary to run this as root in some cases.

USAGE:

	-c | --check-files platform.txt
		check if files in platform.txt are present on the system
		and validate the data in those files against the specified.
	-p | --check-pkgs pkgs.txt
		check if specified packages are present on the system.
	-l | --check-libs libs
		check if specified libraries are present on the system.
	-h | --help Print help message and exit.
	-v | --version Print version and exit.
	-V | --verbose Print messages per failure and summary results.

INPUT FILE FORMAT:

-c option
	takes an input file with list of required files. Each line
	specifies a file and data range. It checks if files exist.
	If file is a regular files, it will check the contents.

	Each line in the input file has comma separated fields.i e.g:

	/sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness,4000,5000

	The above will expand to find all max_brightness file.
	Data is compared to be within the range: 4000 < data < 5000

	/sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness,4000,

	The above will expand to find all max_brightness file.
	Data in the file is matched to 4000.

	If file contains a string as in the example:
	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path

	Using input as follows, will match the string to the data in the
	file on the system.

	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path,\_SB_.PCI0.P0P1,

	Sample input:

	/sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness,4000,5000
	/sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness,4000,4500
	/sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness,4000,
	/sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness,,5000
	/sys/class/lcd/*/acl_control,4000,5000
	/sys/class/lcd/*/lcd_power, ,
	/dev/video0, ,
	/dev/fb0, ,
	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path,\_SB_.PCI0.P0P1,
	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path,pci0.p0p1,
	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path,,

	Sample Output:

	Check Platform Results:
System is missing required kernel files specified in ../platform.txt
	/sys/class/lcd/*/acl_control
	/sys/class/lcd/*/lcd_power
Some required kernel files in ../platform.txt don't have data to check
	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path
Some required kernel files specified in ../platform.txt have invalid data
	/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness
	/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness
	/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
	/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness
	/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
	/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness
	/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
	/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:01/path

-p option
	takes an input file with list of required packages. e.g:

	libdrm
	libsysfs

	It will check if the specified packages are installed on
	the system.

	Sample Input:

	libdrm
	libsysfs
	libfoo

	Sample Output:

	System is missing required pkgs specified in ../pkgs.txt
		libfoo

-l option
	takes an input file with list of required libraries. e.g:

	fi1236_drv.so
	tda8425_drv.so
	tda9885_drv.so
	libdrm.so.2

	It will check if the specified libraries are installed on
	the system.

	Sample Input:

	fi1236_drv.so
	tda8425_drv.so
	tda9885_drv.so
	libdrm.so.2
	libfoo.so.2

	System is missing required libraries specified in ../libs.txt
		libfoo.so.2

Verbose option will print messages for each missing files/package/library.
In the case of files with invalid data, it will include the data found and
the data specified in the input file. If input file didn't specify data, it
will alert the user of that fact.

USE CASES:

1. Users can ensure all the kernel files (sys,dev, etc.), packages,
   and libraries they need are present on a Linux platform either after
   a fresh install or upgrade or after installing a new kernel. It also
   checks data in the kernel files against what the expected data to
   ensure the sysfs files contain valid data.

2. Tizen BSP vendors can ensure all the OAL kernel files (sys,dev etc.)
   are present on a tizen platform. It also checks data in the kernel
   files against what the expected data to ensure the sysfs files contain
   valid data. In addition to that it can be used to check whether or not
   the packages and libraries necessary to support Tizen user-space are
   present on the platform.

PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add capability to test user specified features and capabilities.
   drm, v4l2, sensor, input sub-system, sound, and communication
   (3G, LTE etc.).
2. Add capability to generate input files.

Contributions are accepted gladly.
